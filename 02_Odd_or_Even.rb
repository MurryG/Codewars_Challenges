# Original code:
  def even_or_odd(number)

  end

# Instructions:
  # Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an 
  # nteger as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or
  # "Odd" for odd numbers.

# My Solution:
  def even_or_odd(number)
    
    if number % 2 == 0
      "Even"
    else
      "Odd"
    end
  end
